# A 14th century CE *Brucella melitensis* genome and its recent Western Mediterranean expansion

The code and data starts after creating the *B.melitensis* pan-genome and pulling out the deduplicated mappings against the reference genome. The scripts and steps used to get to this point can be found at [LongBioinformatics](https://github.com/longg2/LongBioinformatics).

Please note that the COG database is not included due to size limitations. The version used for this publication can be found [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/COG2020/data/).
