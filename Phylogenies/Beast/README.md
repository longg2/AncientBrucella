# BEAST Analysis

_BeastSummarizing.R_ was used to determine the required burn-in, determine the ESS, create the trace plots, and finally summarize the phylogenies. It requires that both the log and trees file from the analysis are present. Only the log files are included here due to size limitations, however, it will still be able to determine the burn-in.
